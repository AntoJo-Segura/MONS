  DESCRIPTION                  = "
  The DND product contains normalized neutron counting rates for all four of
  the Neutron Spectrometer prisms, from which thermal and epithermal neutron
  count rates are determined. 

  Thermal and epithermal count rates are included in the data set.
  Background-corrected and normalized fast counting data are also provided for
  the nadir-looking prism (Prism 1).  The data is presented in a table format
  with one row of data for each NS collection interval within a 24 Earth hour
  period. The DND data can be used along with models and calibration
  procedures described in the literature [Feldman et al., 2003; Prettyman et
  al., 2004] to study the composition and structure of the surface and
  atmosphere of Mars on sub-seasonal time scales.
